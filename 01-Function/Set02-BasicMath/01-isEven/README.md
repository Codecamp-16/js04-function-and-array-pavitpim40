Create a JavaScript function named isEven that takes an integer as input and determines whether the number is even or odd. The function should return true if the input is an even number and false if it's an odd number.

For instance:

If the input is 4, the function should return true because 4 is an even number.
If the input is 7, the function should return false as 7 is an odd number.
