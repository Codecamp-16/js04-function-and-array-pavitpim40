- S1 : Understand the problem

  - can I restate the problem in my own words ?
  - What are the inputs that go into the problem?
  - What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
  - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enougn information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That’s okay. it’s still worth considering the question at this early stage.
  - How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

- S2 : explore concrete example

```js
fizzbuzz(1) == 1;
fizzbuzz(2) === 2;
fizzbuzz(3) === 'fizz';
fizzbuzz(5) === 'buzz';
fizzbuzz(15) == 'fizzbuzz';
```

- S3 : Break it down
- S4 : Try to Solve / IF cant (Simplify)
