Create a JavaScript function named fizzBuzz that takes a numerical input and applies the following rules:

- If the input is divisible by 3, return the string "Fizz".
- If the input is divisible by 5, return the string "Buzz".
- If the input is divisible by both 3 and 5, return the string "FizzBuzz".
- If none of the above conditions are met, return the input number itself.

For example:

- If the input is 9, the function should return "Fizz" because 9 is divisible by 3.
- If the input is 20, the function should return "Buzz" because 20 is divisible by 5.
- If the input is 15, the function should return "FizzBuzz" since 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5.
- If the input is 7, the function should return 7 because none of the conditions are satisfied.
